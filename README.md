## Transportation Problem Solver with Northwest Corner Method

The Northwest Corner Method used to find an initial feasible solution for the transportation problem in operations research and linear programming. The transportation problem involves determining the most cost-effective way to transport goods from a set of suppliers to a set of consumers.

## Features
- Cell Assignment: Populates the cost matrix with user input for each cell.
- Supply and Demand Assignment: Takes user input for supply and demand quantities.
- Northwest Corner Method:  Implements the algorithm to find an initial solution.

## Usage
1. Enter the number of suppliers and demanders.
2. Input the transportation costs for each cell.
3. Specify the supply quantities from each supplier and demand quantities from each demander.
4. The code will output the initial solution and total cost, along with a detailed list of assignments made, specifying the cells and quantities assigned.
